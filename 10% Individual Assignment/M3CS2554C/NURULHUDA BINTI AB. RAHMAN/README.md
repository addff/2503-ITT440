## Identifying Colors with OpenCV and Pandas

### Introduction to OpenCV and Pandas
OpenCV (Open Source Computer Vision Library) is a powerful library used for image processing and computer vision tasks. It provides tools for manipulating images and videos, detecting objects, applying filters, and even performing machine learning-based image analysis. OpenCV is widely used in applications such as facial recognition, augmented reality, and automated image classification.

Pandas is a data manipulation and analysis library designed for handling structured data efficiently. It provides tools for loading, filtering, and transforming datasets using intuitive data structures like DataFrames. In these scripts, Pandas is used to read a CSV file containing color names and RGB values, allowing easy comparison and matching of colors.

By combining OpenCV for image processing and Pandas for data handling, these scripts efficiently identify and display color names from images and webcam feeds.
