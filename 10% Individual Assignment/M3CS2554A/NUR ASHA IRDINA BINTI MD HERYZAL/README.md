Real-time Object Detection with keras

ðŸ’¡ Introduction
In this project, we combine two critical computer vision techniques: real-time object detection and image enhancement. Object detection identifies and localizes objects within an image, while image enhancement improves the quality of the input to make detection more accurate and reliable.

This solution uses the MobileNet SSD model pre-trained for object detection, and OpenCV for image processing. The goal is to capture real-time video input, detect objects, improve the image quality, and display bounding boxes around detected objects with labels.

The key steps in this process include:

Real-time Object Detection: Detecting various objects from a video feed using a pre-trained model.


Display and Labeling: Visualizing the result on the screen with labeled bounding boxes around detected objects.
