#### Objectives:
 * To understand PyCairo tools used for cvg in Python
 * To develop high-quality graphics using PyCairo

#### PyCairo
  ~ PyCairo stands as a crucial Python binding for the robust Cairo graphics library, effectively bringing its powerful 2D rendering capabilities into the Python ecosystem. It empowers developers to programmatically generate high-quality vector graphics that remain crisp and clear regardless of scaling. Through pycairo, Python applications gain the ability to draw a diverse array of shapes, intricate paths, and text with precise control over styling, transformations, and compositing. Furthermore, its versatility extends to supporting multiple output formats, including popular image and vector file types, as well as various display backends, making it an invaluable tool for creating visualizations, diagrams, and other graphical elements within Python projects.
  
  ~ It is designed to match the cairo C API as closely as possible, and to deviate only in cases which are clearly better implemented in a more 'Pythonic' way.
