 ## WHAT IS DEEPFACE? 

 DeepFace is a lightweight face recognition and facial attribute analysis(age, gender, emotion and race) framework(API) for pyhton. It is a hybrid face recognition framework wrapping 
 state-of-the-art models like VGG-Face, FaceNet, OpenFace, Facebook DeepFace, DeepID, ArcFace, Dlib, SFace. 

 In short, DeepFace is library that support python and using powerful deep learning model without required user to have extensive knowledge of the underlying algorithms. Plus, it handles 
 complexities of model loading, face detection and feature extraction

 ## KEY CHARACTERISTICS AND ADVANTAGES OF DEEPFACE 
 ### 1.High-Level API
 Provide intuitive interface for complex face analysis. User can get results by few lines of code. 

 ### 2. Multiple Backends 
 Supports many type of state-of-the-art deep learning for face recognition such as VGG-Face, FaceNet, OpenFace, DeepID, ArcFace, Dlib and more. Users can use any type of state-of-the-art
 that meets their requirement based on accurancy and performance. 

 ### 3. Multiple Face Detectors
 Integrates with different face detection like OpenCV, SSD, Dlib, MTCNN and RetinaFace. It help to recognize and detect multiple faces in an image. 

 ### 4. Ease of Use
 Accesible for both which are beginner or experienced user in the field of computer vision and deep learning. Plus, the deepface library also easy to downlaod and can be download on pip. 

 ### 5. Open Source
 Free to use and modify. 

 ### 6. Cross-Platform
 Can be used on various operating system such as Windows, macOS and linux as it is built with Python. 

 ## WHAT IS CVG? 
 CVG is computer vision graphics. Computer vision focuses on understanding and extract meaningful information from images and videos such as like face recognition. Computer vision also 
 required algorithm for process to analysze visual data, identify patterns and make infrences. Nowadays, CVG like face recognition getting popular around the world for improvement in 
 security, user experience and also marketing. Face recognition can be used at border control and immegration for security of country, can be used to unlock mobile phones for more quicker 
 and also can be applied for facial treatment. 

 ## JUPYTER NOTEBOOK

 Jupyter Notebook was used to install deepface and run python code that related to face recognition. 
 Jupyter is open-source web application that allows you to create and share documents that contain live code, equations, visualizations and narrative text.
