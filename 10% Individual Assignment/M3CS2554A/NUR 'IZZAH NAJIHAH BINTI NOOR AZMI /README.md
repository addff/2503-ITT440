# CVG & Image Processing using ImageAI 

# 1. FRAMEWORK
## TensorFlow & Keras (Used with ImageAI)
### What is TensorFlow & Keras?
ImageAI is not a standalone framework. It works on top of **TensorFlow** and **Keras**, which are poweful deep learning frameworks. TensorFlow is an open-source platform developed by Google for machine learning, while Keras is a high-level neural networks API written in Phyton that runs on top of TensorFlow. These frameworks provide the foundation for the deep learning models that ImageAI uses.

## What is ImageAI?
ImageAI is a Python library that empowers developers to easily integrate state-of-the-art deep learning models for object detection, image classification, and even video analysis into their applications. The library abstracts the complexity of deep learning model deployment and provides a simple and intuitive API for working with pre-trained models like YOLOv3, RetinaNet, and others. ImageAI is suitable for various applications in fields such as security, autonomous vehicles, and healthcare.

## Features and Functionality
### 1. Object Detection
ImageAI allows users to detect and identify objects in images and videos using state-of-the-art-deep learning models such as RetinaNet, YOLOv3, and TinyYOLO.
### 2. Image Prediction
It supports image classification using pre-trained models like ResNet, DenseNet, SqueezeNet, and InceptionV3.
### 3. Video Object Detection
ImageAI can process video files or real-time webcam feeds to detect and track objects.
### 4. Custom Model Training
Users can train custom image classifiers using ImageAI and datasets of their own, using Transfer learning.
### 5. Simplicity
ImageAI provides a very beginner-friendly and Pythonic syntax that makes it accessibe even to non-experts in AI.
### 6. Real-time Processing
It enables real-time object detection and alert systems when integrated with caemras.

## Uses of ImageAI
### 1. Security systems
Detect intruders or monitor surveillance videos.
### 2. Retail analytics
Track product movement or customer behavior.
