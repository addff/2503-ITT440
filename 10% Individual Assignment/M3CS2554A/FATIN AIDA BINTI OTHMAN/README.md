Objective
To write an article about Image Processing using SCIKIT-IMAGE tools
To demonstrate the coding and functions used in SCIKIT-IMAGE related to the topic.

Introduction to Image Processing

Image processing involves enhancing and analyzing digital images through algorithmic and mathematical techniques. The scikit-image library in Python offers a wide range of tools for image preprocessing, analysis, and visualization. It is widely used in practical applications such as industrial inspection, surveillance, and medical imaging, reflecting its growing relevance in fields like computer vision and machine learning.

What is SCIKIT-IMAGES ?

Scikit-image (also known as skimage) is one of the open-source image-processing libraries for the Python programming language. It provides a powerful toolbox of algorithms and functions for various image processing and computer vision tasks and it is built on top of popular scientific libraries like NumPy and SciPy.ndimage. Scikit-image also known image processing Python package that works with NumPy arrays which is a collection of algorithms for image processing.

Feature of SCIKIT-IMAGES:

1. Open-source package in Python. This means that it is available free of charge and free of restriction.
2. Easy to read and write images of various formats. The library offers multiple plugins and methods to read and write images of various formats, such as JPEG, PNG, TIFF, and more.
3. Images in scikit-image are represented by NumPy ndarrays (multidimentional containers). Hence, many common operations can be achieved using standard NumPy methods for manipulating arrays.
4. It provides a vast collection of image Processing Algorithms such as filtering, segmentation, feature extraction, morphology, and more.
5. User-friendly API that simplifies the process of performing image processing tasks.
