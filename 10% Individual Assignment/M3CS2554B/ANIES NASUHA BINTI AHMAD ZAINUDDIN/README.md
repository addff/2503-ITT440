# Computer Vision Graphics (CVG) using Pygame

üì∏ Computer Vision Graphics (CVG) is a field that focuses on the visualization and presentation of image and video data using graphical elements. Unlike image processing, which manipulates pixel-level data for analysis, CVG emphasizes how visual data is represented and interacted with in a graphical interface.

I made a decision to choose pygame because it is one of the popular tools that can be used in Python for CVG-related projects. Pygame is a cross-platform set of Python modules designed for creating video games, but it also supports multimedia applications, including CVG tasks.

Pygame is an open-source library that is based on SDL (Simple Direct Media Layer), It also supports 2D graphics, sounds, and event handling, making it ideal for visual and interactive applications. Eventhough Pygame is commonly utilized for developing games and multimedia applications. Nonetheless, it also highly useful for Computer Vision Graphics (CVG) projects involving real-time visuals and graphical data presentation.

 ## Why use Pygame for CVG ?

‚úîÔ∏è Overlay graphics or text on video/image 

‚úîÔ∏è Allows rendering of dynamic image frames or video-based graphics easily.

‚úîÔ∏è Supports real-time interaction through keyboard, mouse, or frame updates.

‚úîÔ∏è Simplifies development for students or beginners new to computer vision or graphical rendering.

‚úîÔ∏è Can be used to simulate image-based animations, visual tracking output, or frame-based displays.

## Programming languange

- Pygame is written in python

- Works weel with python 3.7 - 3.13

## Tools needed for Pygame

üí†Python - main language Pygame

üí†Pygame library - rendering and visuals

üí†Visual studio code - writing and running code

üí†Images or videos

## Pygame Installation 
1. Make sure Python is installed (python 3.13)

2. Open command prompt

3. Run the following command
   
<pre> pip install pygame </pre>

4. To verify installation

<pre> python -m pygame.examples.aliens </pre>
   
 ## Steps To Implement Pygme in a CVG Project

1. Install Python & Pygame

2. Prepare the image or video

3. Import Pygame and initialize 

<pre>
import pygame
</pre>

4. Create a display surface
   
<pre>screen = pygame.display.set_mode((640, 480))
</pre>

5. Load and display the image

<pre>img = pygame.image.load("your_image.jpg")
screen.blit(img, (0, 0))
pygame.display.update()
</pre>

6. Create a game loop

<pre>
running = True
while running:
    for event in pygame.event.get():
        if event.type == pygame.QUIT:
            running = False
pygame.quit()
</pre>

## Advantages of using Pygame

üß† **Easy to learn and use**
    
Pygame has a simple and beginner friendly syntax, making it accessible even for students who are new to graphics programming or Python

‚öôÔ∏è **Minimal setup**

Installation is straightforward with a single pip install pygame command and also there are no complex configurations or external 
dependencies needed. 

üé• **Great for frame by frame rendering**

The whole aspect of Pygame is in handling 2D graphics and creating static or dynamic image sequences. This is very useful for CVG tasks such as video frame display, animated images, or simulation.

üéÆ **Support real time interaction**

With its embedded event handling, Pygame allows the program to interact with keyboard, mouse, or user input events, a special feature in interactive CVG applications, such as sliders, buttons, or live frame control.

üçÇ **Lightweight and efficient**

Pygame is specialized for speed and performance in 2D graphics. The library can be especially handy for systems with limited hardware or when projects need smooth performance without performance lag.

üõ†Ô∏è **Flexible and customizable**

Can easily overlay or overlay text, shapes, or other graphics on top of images and video frames, this produces an interesting and informative CVG output. It is also suitable for both basic visual output, such as image displays, and advanced GUIs or animated simulations.

# 1. OBJECT TRACKING USING PYGAME
- This project demonstrates a basic form of interactive object tracking using a single static image.

- When the image is displayed using Pygame, user can click anywhere on the image. The program captures the position of the mouse click and interprets it as a point of interest like simulating an object detection. Once the click is detected, the program automatically draws a green diamond shape around the clicked region. This visually indicates the area of interest or the ‚Äúdetected object.‚Äù

# 2. MOTION DETECTION

- This project is a simplified simulation of motion detection using a moving shape instead of real camera input.
  
- Although it is not detecting real-world motion, it simulates how motion can be tracked and visualized by updating the position of an object in each frame.

# 3. INTERACTIVE FACE CONTROLLED GAME

- The Face Jumper project is an interactive CVG application where the player's facial position, captured in real-time through a webcam, is used to control a character inside a game built with Pygame.

- Using face detection using OpenCV, the system identifies the position of the player‚Äôs face in each video frame. That position data is then passed to the Pygame environment to control the in-game character's movement.

- This project combines real-time computer vision and graphical rendering. Although due to project restrictions only Pygame is used in this case, the concept simulates how face data could be integrated into a game.

## Conclusion

Throughout the development of various mini projects under Computer Vision Graphics (CVG) using Pygame, several key concepts have been successfully explored and demonstrated. These projects, including object tracking, motion detection, image interaction, and an interactive face-controlled game simulation (Face Jumper), shows how visual data and graphics can be integrated to create engaging and intelligent user interfaces. 
By using Pygame, a lightweight and beginner-friendly graphics library in Python, each project was developed with a focus on visual interaction, real-time feedback, and frame-based control. These implementations highlight how graphical simulation can effectively represent the core principles of computer vision.

In conclusion, I admit there are a lot of valuable learning experience in understanding the graphical side of computer vision. It proves that with the right approach, even basic tools can deliver meaningful visual outputs and interactive elements that are central to the field of CVG.
