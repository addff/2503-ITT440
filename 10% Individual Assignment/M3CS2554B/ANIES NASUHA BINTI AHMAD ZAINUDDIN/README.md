# Computer Vision Graphics (CVG) using Pygame

📸 Computer Vision Graphics (CVG) is a field that focuses on the visualization and presentation of image and video data using graphical elements. Unlike image processing, which manipulates pixel-level data for analysis, CVG emphasizes how visual data is represented and interacted with in a graphical interface.

I made a decision to choose pygame because it is one of the popular tools that can be used in Python for CVG-related projects. Pygame is a cross-platform set of Python modules designed for creating video games, but it also supports multimedia applications, including CVG tasks.

Pygame is an open-source library that is based on SDL (Simple Direct Media Layer), It also supports 2D graphics, sounds, and event handling, making it ideal for visual and interactive applications. Eventhough Pygame is commonly utilized for developing games and multimedia applications. Nonetheless, it also highly useful for Computer Vision Graphics (CVG) projects involving real-time visuals and graphical data presentation.

 ## Why use Pygame for CVG ?

✔️ Overlay graphics or text on video/image 

✔️ Allows rendering of dynamic image frames or video-based graphics easily.

✔️ Supports real-time interaction through keyboard, mouse, or frame updates.

✔️ Simplifies development for students or beginners new to computer vision or graphical rendering.

✔️ Can be used to simulate image-based animations, visual tracking output, or frame-based displays.
