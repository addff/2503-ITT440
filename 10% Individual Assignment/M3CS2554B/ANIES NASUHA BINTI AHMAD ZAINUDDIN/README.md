# Computer Vision Graphics (CVG) using PyGame

üëÅÔ∏è‚Äçüó®Ô∏è Computer Vision Graphics (CVG) is a field that focuses on the visualization and presentation of image and video data using graphical elements. Unlike image processing, which manipulates pixel-level data for analysis, CVG emphasizes how visual data is represented and interacted with in a graphical interface.

I made a decision to choose pygame because it is one of the popular tools that can be used in Python for CVG-related projects is. Pygame is a cross-platform set of Python modules designed for writing video games, but it also supports multimedia applications, including CVG tasks.

Pygame is an open-source library that is based on SDL (Simple Direct Media Layer), and it is commonly utilized for developing games and multimedia applications. Nonetheless, it also acts as a powerful instrument for creating interactive graphic systems.
