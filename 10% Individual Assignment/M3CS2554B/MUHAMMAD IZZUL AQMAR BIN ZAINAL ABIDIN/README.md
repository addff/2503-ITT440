## üõ†Ô∏è Installation & Setup

### Step 1: Install MATLAB
- Download MATLAB from the [MathWorks website](https://www.mathworks.com/products/matlab.html).
- Follow the installation instructions based on your operating system.

### Step 2: Install Required Toolboxes
Ensure you have the following toolboxes installed:
- Image Processing Toolbox
- Computer Vision Toolbox
- Deep Learning Toolbox (optional, for AI applications)

You can install these using the Add-On Explorer:
```
Home Tab > Add-Ons > Get Add-Ons > Search and Install
```

Or use the command line:
```matlab
matlab.addons.install('Computer Vision Toolbox')
```

### Step 3: Set Up Your Workspace
- Clone this repository or create a new folder in MATLAB.
- Add your scripts and images to this folder.

### Step 4: Test with an Example
Run the provided face detection example (see below) to verify your setup.

## üöÄ Why Use MATLAB for Computer Vision?

- üõ†Ô∏è **Image Processing Toolbox**: Image filtering, transformation, and analysis.
- üß† **Computer Vision Toolbox**: Object detection, motion tracking, feature matching, etc.
- ü§ñ **Deep Learning Integration**: Use CNNs for image classification and detection.
- üìà **Visualization**: Easy debugging and presentation of image data.

## üîç Key Applications

### 1. Object Detection and Recognition
Detect objects like faces using built-in classifiers or train your own (e.g., YOLO, SSD).

### 2. Feature Extraction and Matching
Use algorithms like SIFT, SURF, or ORB for finding key points across images.

### 3. Image Classification
Train or fine-tune CNNs for image labeling and recognition tasks.

### 4. Motion Analysis
Track motion using optical flow, background subtraction, and frame differencing.

### 5. 3D Vision
Reconstruct depth and scene geometry using stereo vision.

### 6. Camera Calibration
Estimate camera parameters, correct lens distortions, and calibrate multi-camera systems.

## üß™ Example: Face Detection in MATLAB

Here's a quick example using the built-in Viola-Jones algorithm:

```matlab
% Read image
img = imread('peppers.png');

% Create a face detector object
faceDetector = vision.CascadeObjectDetector();

% Detect faces
bbox = step(faceDetector, img);

% Draw bounding boxes
detectedImg = insertShape(img, 'Rectangle', bbox);

% Show result
imshow(detectedImg);
```
